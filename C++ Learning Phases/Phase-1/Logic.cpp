/* 
Before the main logic starts, you must include the libraries that give the program its 'senses' and 'tools'

#include <iostream>: For input and output (cin and cout). 

#include <cmath>: Essential for the sqrt() function. You aren't calculating square roots by hand; use the library.



Standard C++ functions live in the std namespace.

The Disciplined Way: Use std::cout and std::cin.

The Shortcut: using namespace std; (Common for beginners, 
  but in larger projects like your Optimization Engine, 
  it can cause naming conflicts. 
  Learn to use the std:: prefix now to build better habits).


  By convention, the main function should return 0 when finished
