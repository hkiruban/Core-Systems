/*
In C++, ++i (prefix) is often more efficient than i++ (postfix) because it doesn't create a temporary copy of the variable.

for loop: Best for when you know exactly how many times to run (e.g., "Calculate the average for 5 assignments").

while loop: Best for when you’re waiting for a condition (e.g., "Keep calculating until the user enters -1").
