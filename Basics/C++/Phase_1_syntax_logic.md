# Phase I: The Foundation (Syntax & Logic)
This phase is dedicated to mastering the raw mechanics of C++.

## Focus Areas
* **Variable Architecture:** Understanding `int`, `double`, `float`, and `bool`. Knowing when to prioritize precision over memory.
* **Data Types & Limits:** Recognizing the boundaries of standard types to prevent overflow in high-frequency calculations.
* **Control Flow (The Logic Gates):** Mastering `if/else` branching and `switch` statements to handle system states.
* **Iteration (The Grinders):** Using `for`, `while`, and `do-while` loops to process data arrays and repeat tactical operations.
* **Logical Operators:** Precise use of `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT) to define complex conditions.
