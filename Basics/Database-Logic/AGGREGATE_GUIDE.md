# SQL Foundations: The Inquisitor Series
This directory contains the core logic for data extraction and systemic auditing.

## Key Functions Mastered

### 1. Data Aggregation
* **COUNT()**: Used to quantify the dataset. Essential for volume analysis.
* **AVG()**: Used to find the mean of performance metrics (e.g., Average Return, Average Risk).

### 2. Logic Gates (Filters)
* **WHERE**: Row-level filtering. Used to isolate specific failures.
* **HAVING**: Group-level filtering. Used to isolate systemic failures within an asset class.

### 3. Data Organization
* **GROUP BY**: Used to categorize raw data into logical sets (e.g., AssetClass, TradeType).
* **ORDER BY**: Used to prioritize data based on magnitude (e.g., sorting by highest loss).
