# Phase II: Tactical Precision (Functions & Scope)
Goal: Transition from monolithic scripting to modular architecture.

## Objectives
* **Abstraction:** Isolate mathematical formulas into dedicated functions.
* **Memory Efficiency:** Use references (`&`) to avoid unnecessary data copying.
* **Overloading:** Handle multiple numeric precisions (int, float, double).

## Completion Criteria
* [ ] Build a modular calculator that handles complex math types.
* [ ] Implement a "Risk Check" function that uses pass-by-reference.
* [ ] Zero global variables. Everything must be scoped and controlled.
